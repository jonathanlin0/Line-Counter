To run the program as it is, simply compile and run LineCounter.java

To run specific tests, run the appropriate test and then retrieve the
appropriate value. For example, to retrieve the number of lines in a directory,
simply create a LineCounter object, call countNumberOfLines() using the object, 
then call getNumberOfLines() using the object.

If you would like to incorporate this tool into your code, simply create a
LineCounter object and set the specific parameters you want, such as
isHighPerformance.

I have added JAVADOCS to all the functions for convenience and readability
sake.
